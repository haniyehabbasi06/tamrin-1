# Student Registry — Python Assignment

Project description

This is a small university assignment implemented in Python. The program collects student records (name, student ID, age, and major) and stores them in a Python dictionary. The project demonstrates basic data structures, simple input/output, and common operations such as adding, updating, removing, and listing student entries.

## Features

- Collect and store student information: name, student ID, age, and major.
- Add, update, and remove student records.
- List all students or search by student ID.
- Simple, easy-to-read code suitable for learning and grading.

## Installation

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer

Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Unix / macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program runs in a simple interactive mode (or uses command-line options depending on your implementation). Typical operations include:

- Add a student
- Update a student record
- Remove a student
- List all students
- Find a student by ID

Example command (interactive):

```bash
python main.py
# then follow prompts to add or list students
```

## Example input/output

Example: adding two students (user input shown after prompts)

Input

```
> Add student
Name: Alice Smith
Student ID: S1001
Age: 20
Major: Computer Science

> Add student
Name: Bob Jones
Student ID: S1002
Age: 21
Major: Mathematics

> List students
```

Output

```
S1001: Alice Smith, Age: 20, Major: Computer Science
S1002: Bob Jones, Age: 21, Major: Mathematics
```

## Dictionary structure

Student records are stored in a Python dictionary keyed by `student_id`. Each value is a nested dictionary containing the student's attributes. Example:

```python
students = {
	"S1001": {"name": "Alice Smith", "age": 20, "major": "Computer Science"},
	"S1002": {"name": "Bob Jones", "age": 21, "major": "Mathematics"},
}

# Add a new record
students["S1003"] = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 19, "major": "Physics"}

# Update an existing record
students["S1001"]["major"] = "Software Engineering"

# Remove a record
del students["S1002"]
```

Common operations

- Lookup by ID: `students.get(student_id)`
- Iterate all records: `for sid, data in students.items():`
- Validate inputs before insertion (e.g., ensure `student_id` is unique)

## Project structure

Example layout for this assignment:

- `main.py` — program entry point (interactive menu or CLI)
- `tamrin1.py` — helper functions or alternate implementation (if present)
- `Readme` — this README (if you prefer `README.md`, see note below)
- `requirements.txt` — optional dependency list

Note: On some systems a folder named `Readme.md` may already exist; if you prefer a file named `README.md` I can create or move the content accordingly.

## Contributing

This is a small assignment, but contributions or improvements are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-or-feature`
2. Make changes and add tests where appropriate.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Guidelines

- Keep code clear and well-documented.
- Follow PEP 8 style for Python code.
- Include short unit tests for new functions if applicable.
